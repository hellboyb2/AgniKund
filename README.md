# AgniKund

It is a tool for learning purpose only for students and researchers. 

For students who are trying to learn , my advise would be to go to Reflected section first then dom then stored.

For Researchers the Custom section in Reflected section will provide you to construct your own injection environment in a simple way. The document is pretty much self explanatory. It will have a docker installation too. I will update the command to get it's docker repo.

To run this server go into the AgniKund-XSS_Playground folder and run the command 

php -S localhost:8000 -t ./ ./route.php
